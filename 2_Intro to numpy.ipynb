NumPy is a crucial library for effectively loading, storing, and manipulating in-memory data in Python, all of which will be at the heart of what you do with data science in Python.\n\nDatasets come from a huge range of sources and in a wide range of formats, such as text documents, images, sound clips, numerical measurements, and nearly anything else. Despite this variety, however, the start of data science is to think of all data fundamentally as arrays of numbers.\n\nFor example, the words in documents can be represented as the numbers that encode letters in computers or even the frequency of particular words in a collection of documents. Digital images can be thought of as two-dimensional arrays of numbers representing pixel brightness or color. Sound files can be represented as one-dimensional arrays of frequency versus time. However, no matter what form our data takes, in order to analyze it, our first step will be to transform it into arrays of numbers—which is where NumPy comes in (and pandas down the road).\n\nNumPy is short for *Numerical Python*, and it provides an efficient means of storing and operating on dense data buffers in Python. Array-oriented computing in Python goes back to 1995 with the Numeric library. Scientific programming in Python took off over the next 10 years, but the collections of libraries splintered. The NumPy project began in 2005 as a means of bringing the Numeric and NumArray projects together around a single array-based framework.\n\nLet's get started exploring NumPy! Our first step will be to import NumPy using `np` as an alias:"

That range of months started at the third row of the CSV file (remember, Python zero-indexes!) and ran through the thirteenth row, hence `2:14]`.\n\nYou now have an array containing 12 values, each of which records the monthly rainfall in inches from January to December 2003.\n\nCommonly in data science, you will want to take a quick first exploratory look at the data. In this case, a bar chart is a good way to do this. To generate this bar chart, we will use Matplotlib, another important data-science tool that we will introduce formally later in the course.

We know that the length of our array is 12, but it can be a good habit to get into to programmatically pass the length of an array in case it changes or you don’t know it with specificity. We also added 1 to both the start and the end of the `arange` to accommodate for Python zero-indexing (because there is no “month-zero” in the calendar).\n\nLooking at the chart above (and as residents can attest), Seattle can have lovely, sunny summers. However, this is only a first glimpse of the data. There are still several questions we would like to answer, such as in how many months did it rain, or what was the average precipitation in those months? We would use masking to answer those questions. (We will also return to this example dataset to demonstrate concepts throughout the rest of this section.)
