# Machine Learning Mentorship

This is the repository that contains all the material/code required to get started with the mentorship programme. A few points of administration:

1. The length of the mentorship is around 5 weeks.

2. We assume you have some prior knowledge of programming.

3. For any help with the course, you can contact your mentor. A better option would be to open an issue on this repository, so that others can see your question, and it'll prevent any replicated effort on the part of the mentor. All discussions related to code will happen over issues.

4. All your code will be pushed to GitHub, so if you haven't already, create a GitHub account. Create a private repository with the name: ml-winter-mentorship and add only your mentor as a collaborator. The mentors GitHub ids are: @CheshtaK.

5. Create a README.md in your repository where you can keep track of your progress over the next month. The mentors will be using the README.md as a progress tracker.

Don't be afraid to ask any questions (however irrelevant you think it may be). The mentors are here to help you every step of the way.


## Prerequisites

1. Language: We'll be using Python3 throughout this course. So familiarise yourself with the language. Also learn to install packages using pip.

2. Libraries:

    a. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Used for matrix computations.
    
    b. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Used for data analysis.

4. Tools:

    a. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
    
    b. git: You'll be using GitHub for all your code/assignment submission, so learn the basics of git: pull, push, add, commit.


## Scope

The scope of this course will be rather narrow due to the time constraint, but we hope you'll learn the foundational level of machine learning that'll help you along the way when you decide to learn more advanced concepts.

## Resources

Since every one prefers a different approach to learning, we're gonna try our best to accomodate each style. Every topic has multiple levels of resources:

1. Intuitive: This will be a high level, hand-wavy explanation of the concepts. This will not help you understand the core of the concept, but you will have a general understanding.

2. Code: If you prefer to learn by looking at the codebase, we'll link open source implementations of the algorithm (where appropriate).

3. Lectures: We'll link free online YouTube lectures.

The recommendation would be to either use Lectures or Text Books to get a solid grasp of the conceptual details, and to use the Code as a reference during the assignment. Please note that we don't tolerate any plagiarism.

At the end of each week you will be given a set of deliverables to complete. This could either be a report, or a coding assignment. All submissions will happen via GitHub.
