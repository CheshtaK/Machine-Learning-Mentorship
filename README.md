# Machine Learning Mentorship

This is the repository that contains all the material/code required to get started with the mentorship programme. A few points of administration:

1. The length of the mentorship is around 5 weeks.

2. We assume you have some prior knowledge of programming.

3. For any help with the course, you can contact your mentor. A better option would be to open an issue on this repository, so that others can see your question, and it'll prevent any replicated effort on the part of the mentor.

4. All your code will be pushed to GitHub, so if you haven't already, create a GitHub account. Fork and clone this repository and create your respective folders (refer the sample folder with my name).

5. Create a README.md in your folder where you can keep track of your progress over the next month. The mentors will be using the README.md as a progress tracker.

Don't be afraid to ask any questions (however irrelevant you think it may be). The mentors are here to help you every step of the way.


## Prerequisites

1. Language: We'll be using Python3 throughout this course. So familiarise yourself with the language. Also learn to install packages using pip.

2. Libraries (Installation):

    a. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Used for matrix computations.
    
    b. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Used for data analysis.
    
    c. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Used for data visualization

4. Tools:

    a. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
    
    b. git: You'll be using GitHub for all your code/assignment submission, so learn the basics of git: pull, push, add, commit.


## Resources

Since every one prefers a different approach to learning, we're gonna try our best to accomodate each style. Every topic has multiple levels of resources:

1. Articles/Blogs: This will give you a detailed explanation for each topic alongwith the relevant mathematics.

2. Code: If you prefer to learn by looking at the codebase, we'll link practical implementations of the topic(wherever appropriate).

3. Lectures: We'll link free online YouTube lectures (wherever appropriate).

The recommendation would be to either use Lectures or Articles to get a solid grasp of the conceptual details, and to use the Code as a reference during the assignment. Please note that we don't tolerate any plagiarism.

At the end of each week you will be given a set of tasks to complete. This could either be a report, or a coding assignment. All submissions will happen via GitHub.
